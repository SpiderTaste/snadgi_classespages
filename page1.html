      <p>Hello!<br>My name is Sali Nadgi, I'm an aspiring artist based in the always flowing, Caribbean Island, of Puerto Rico. Where the people are nice, chillax, rough and you can find every mood under the bright sun. Needless to say, I love my Island. My love for all things art has been in me since I've had memory. From a young age I have bee in some art school, art program, in some private studio or just running around tabletop game shop painting minis, Warhammer 40k to be specific. I have my parents to thank for all my art adventuras, both of the creative in there own ways. Jumping at the moment they found an excuse to stick me into som artistic vernture. When I was growning up it was found that my brain didn't process depth correctly. In order to fix or at least compenate for this visual preception dificulty, art therapy was prescribe. Love at first site.</p>
      <p>My life has pushed me to work mostly work with traditional mediums of art. My BFA is in Visual Arts with a specialization in Drawing. I'm currently studying my MFA with the same specialization in the Interamercan University of Puerto Rico, in San Germ√°n's beautiful campus. Even though my studies are in traditional mediums, it doesn't mean I don't love Digital Art Mediums. Truth be told, I started my hig studies in art moving to Florida and going to an digital art based institute. I specifically went to study animation and garnered quite a few college credits in digital mediums. That a managed to honed while finishing my BFA. Even though I didn't finish my degree in that field, it has given me a greater love for ALL art. And. a set of skills to add to my art production workflow. </p>
	 <p> I hope you like what you see in my portfolio, I had a hell of a time creating my works.<br>Signing off,<br> Sali Nadgi</p>
